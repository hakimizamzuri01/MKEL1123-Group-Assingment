## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* `STM32CubeIDE`

### Step1: Start a project

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install or set up your project.

1.  **Create a new project:**
   
2.  **Chose the pin 13 as output:**
   
### Step2: Bare Metal Coding STM32



1.  **bare metal code for the STM32**
   This use the PIN 13 inside the STM32 as an output using 'ODR' and using 'HAL_WAIT' for delay for 1s, This will loop 1s ON and 1s OFF
   
### Step3: Using SVlinkV2 to link to the hardware

1.  **Connection between the STM32 and SVLinkv2:**

  SVlink v2 pin layout

  stm32 pin layout and make sure stm32 in the program mode
  
   
2.  **upload the code in the STM32:**



### Step4: SET the STM32 in operating mode
